# Introduction to LLM and Generative AI for Energy Sector Professionals - Training Course

This repository contains the source files for a training course designed to introduce non-tech-savvy professionals in the energy sector to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

## Course Summary

The course provides a foundational understanding of AI concepts, explains how LLMs work in simple terms, and offers practical guidance on using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude effectively in a professional context. The content is tailored for individuals in roles such as project development and asset management.

## Current Structure

The course is built as a modern Next.js web application with the following structure:

- **Next.js Framework**: Built with React and TypeScript for a modern, interactive experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and professional styling
- **Media Assets**: Comprehensive visual aids and diagrams in the `public/media/` directory
- **Modular Design**: Clean component structure for easy maintenance and updates

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the course.

## Course Content

The course covers five main modules:

1. **Introduction to AI and LLMs**: Basic concepts and terminology
2. **How LLMs Work**: Simplified explanation of the technology
3. **Practical Applications**: Real-world use cases in the energy sector
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Best practices for effective AI interaction
5. **Ethics and Limitations**: Responsible AI usage and understanding limitations

## Future Improvements

This course serves as a solid foundation, but it can be significantly enhanced. Here are some suggestions for future development:

### 1. Enhanced Interactive Features

- **Quizzes and Assessments**: Interactive quizzes at the end of each module
