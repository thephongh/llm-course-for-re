# Introduction to LLM and Generative AI for Energy Sector Professionals - Training Course

This repository contains the source files for a training course designed to introduce non-tech-savvy professionals in the energy sector to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

## Course Summary

The course provides a foundational understanding of AI concepts, explains how LLMs work in simple terms, and offers practical guidance on using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude effectively in a professional context. The content is tailored for individuals in roles such as project development and asset management.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a streamlined LLM course with the following structure:

### üìÅ netlify-app/
**Production-Ready Static Files** - Ready for deployment
- **Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Pre-built, no build process required
- **Production Optimized** - Minified and optimized assets
- **CDN Ready** - Fast loading and delivery
- **Self-Contained** - Includes all necessary files and configurations

### üìÅ Root Directory
**Next.js Development Environment** - For future development
- **Development Server** - Hot reload and development tools (`npm run dev`)
- **Build System** - Can generate new static exports if needed
- **Configuration** - Next.js setup for potential future enhancements

## Getting Started

### For Local Development

To run the course locally during development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
