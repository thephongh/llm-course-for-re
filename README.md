# Introduction to LLM and Generative AI for Energy Sector Professionals - Training Course

This repository contains the source files for a training course designed to introduce non-tech-savvy professionals in the energy sector to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

## Course Summary

The course provides a foundational understanding of AI concepts, explains how LLMs work in simple terms, and offers practical guidance on using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude effectively in a professional context. The content is tailored for individuals in roles such as project development and asset management.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a streamlined LLM course with the following structure:

### üìÅ netlify-app/
**Production-Ready Version** - Optimized for deployment
- **Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No build process required for deployment
- **Production Optimized** - Minified and optimized assets
- **CDN Ready** - Fast loading and delivery
- **Netlify Optimized** - Includes all necessary deployment configurations

### üìÅ Root Directory
**Next.js Development Environment** - For development and building
- **Development Server** - Hot reload and development tools (`npm run dev`)
- **Build System** - Generates static exports to netlify-app directory
- **Configuration** - Next.js, Netlify, and build configurations

## Getting Started

### For Local Development

To run the course locally during development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the course with hot reload.

### For Local Testing (Production Build)

To test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run build
# This generates static files in netlify-app/

# Serve the static files
cd netlify-app
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the production version.

### For Deployment

The `netlify-app` folder contains ready-to-deploy static files:
1. Deploy the `netlify-app` folder to Netlify
2. Or use the GitHub integration as described in the deployment section

## Course Content

The course covers five main modules:

1. **Introduction to AI and LLMs**: Basic concepts and terminology
2. **How LLMs Work**: Simplified explanation of the technology
3. **Practical Applications**: Real-world use cases in the energy sector
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Best practices for effective AI interaction
5. **Ethics and Limitations**: Responsible AI usage and understanding limitations

## Future Improvements

This course serves as a solid foundation, but it can be significantly enhanced. Here are some suggestions for future development:

### 1. Enhanced Interactive Features

- **Quizzes and Assessments**: Interactive quizzes at the end of each module

- **Interactive Examples**: Live prompt playground for hands-on practice

### 2. Mobile Application

- **Cross-Platform**: React Native or Flutter development
- **Offline Access**: Downloadable content for offline learning
- **Push Notifications**: Learning reminders and updates

### 3. Enhanced Content

- **Video Content**: Embedded video lectures and demonstrations
- **Case Studies**: Energy sector-specific AI implementation examples
- **Resource Library**: Curated additional reading and tools
