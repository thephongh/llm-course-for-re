# Introduction to LLM and Generative AI for Energy Sector Professionals - Training Course

This repository contains the source files for a training course designed to introduce non-tech-savvy professionals in the energy sector to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

## Course Summary

The course provides a foundational understanding of AI concepts, explains how LLMs work in simple terms, and offers practical guidance on using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude effectively in a professional context. The content is tailored for individuals in roles such as project development and asset management.

## Project Structure
