# Introduction to LLM and Generative AI for Energy Sector Professionals - Training Course

This repository contains the source files for a training course designed to introduce non-tech-savvy professionals in the energy sector to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

## Course Summary

The course provides a foundational understanding of AI concepts, explains how LLMs work in simple terms, and offers practical guidance on using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude effectively in a professional context. The content is tailored for individuals in roles such as project development and asset management.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a streamlined LLM course with the following structure:

### üìÅ Root Directory
**Next.js Development Environment** - For future development
- **Development Server** - Hot reload and development tools (`npm run dev`)
- **Build System** - Can generate new static exports if needed
- **Configuration** - Next.js setup and Netlify deployment config (`netlify.toml`)

## Getting Started

### For Local Development

To run the course locally during development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the course with hot reload.

### For Local Testing (Static Files)

To test the production version locally:

```bash
# Serve the pre-built static files
cd netlify-app
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the production version.

## Course Content

The course covers five main modules:

1. **Introduction to AI and LLMs**: Basic concepts and terminology
2. **How LLMs Work**: Simplified explanation of the technology
3. **Practical Applications**: Real-world use cases in the energy sector
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Best practices for effective AI interaction
5. **Ethics and Limitations**: Responsible AI usage and understanding limitations

The project includes optimized configuration for Netlify:

- **`netlify.toml`** - Deployment configuration and redirects (root directory)
- **`next.config.js`** - Next.js development configuration
- **`package.json`** - Dependencies and development scripts

### Current netlify.toml Configuration

```toml
[build]
  # No build command needed - using pre-built static files
  publish = "netlify-app"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/course.html"
  status = 200
```

## Future Improvements

This course serves as a solid foundation, but it can be significantly enhanced. Here are some suggestions for future development:

### 1. Enhanced Interactive Features

- **Quizzes and Assessments**: Interactive quizzes at the end of each module
- **Progress Tracking**: User accounts and progress monitoring
- **Interactive Examples**: Live prompt playground for hands-on practice

### 2. Mobile Application

- **Resource Library**: Curated additional reading and tools

## Troubleshooting

If the site shows "Redirecting to course..." and gets stuck:
1. Check that `course.html` exists in the deployment
2. Verify that redirects are working properly in netlify.toml
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Alternative: Deploy on Vercel

You can also deploy on [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
