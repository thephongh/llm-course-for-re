## FEATURE:

- The web-app folder contains a fully functional small website
- I need to convert this website into a Hugo site that can then be deployed on Netlify or other hosting services
- Respect the liquid glass styling and page styles, boxes, cards
- Add more relevant illustrations to better improve the course
- Remove the requirements to complete one module before proceeding to the next. Let people navigate freely between modules and sections
